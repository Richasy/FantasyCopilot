# Fantasy Copilot Core Plugin

Although the application itself provides some basic commands, adding new commands within the application is not an easy task and is not easily interchangeable. Therefore, the built-in commands of the application are limited to the most basic workflow experience. 

This project will provide a set of common commands, including but not limited to file read and write, network requests, etc., to help users easily build more powerful workflows.
